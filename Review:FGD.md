# Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD)

Implements Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD), gradient descent in which the integer-order gradient is replaced by a fractional-order derivative of the objective.

This entry is a survey of the FGD family rather than a single proprietary optimizer. The unifying idea across the surveyed methods is to substitute the classical gradient $\nabla f$ with a fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ (Caputo, Riemann–Liouville, or related definitions), so the update carries the non-locality and long-memory of fractional calculus. The reviewed variants differ in how they tame this memory: modified fractional-order gradients that avoid singularities and converge to the true extremum, truncation to suppress the oscillatory tail, adaptive step sizes, and variable fractional-order schedules. The canonical FGD step the survey builds on is:

$$
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta_t \, D^{\alpha}_{c}\, f(\theta_t)
$$

where $\theta_t$ are the parameters at step $t$, $\eta_t$ is the (possibly adaptive) step size, $f$ is the objective, $\alpha$ is the fractional order, and $D^{\alpha}_{c}$ denotes the fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ taken with respect to $\theta$ about a base point $c$ (recovering ordinary gradient descent as $\alpha \to 1$).
