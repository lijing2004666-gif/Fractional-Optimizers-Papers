# FGD-ED

Implements FGD-ED, a power-function fractional-order gradient descent that decays the fractional-order term exponentially during training.

Fractional-order gradient descent replaces the integer gradient with a Caputo fractional derivative of the loss, evaluated with the previous iterate as the lower limit. For the power-function form this yields the ordinary gradient scaled by a Gamma-function ratio and by the historical step magnitude raised to $1-\alpha$, which injects a power-law memory of past updates. In practice this memory term causes severe oscillation and gradient explosion late in training.

FGD-ED refines the differentiation formula and multiplies the fractional-order term by an exponentially decaying coefficient $e^{-\kappa t}$, so the update behaves fractionally early on (fast initial convergence) and relaxes toward the ordinary gradient step as training proceeds (oscillation suppression):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta_{t+1} &= \theta_t - \gamma\, \frac{g_t}{\Gamma(2-\alpha)}\, \rho_t\, |\theta_t - \theta_{t-1}|^{\,1-\alpha} \\
\rho_t &= e^{-\kappa t}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\theta$ are the parameters, $\gamma$ the learning rate, $g_t$ the gradient, $\alpha \in (0,1)$ the fractional order, $\Gamma$ the gamma function, $\rho_t$ the exponential decay coefficient with rate $\kappa > 0$, and $|\theta_t - \theta_{t-1}|$ the magnitude of the previous step (the Caputo lower-limit offset). As $\rho_t \to 0$ the power-law memory term vanishes and the rule reduces to ordinary gradient descent.
